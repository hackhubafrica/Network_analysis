	alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 80 (msg:"Custom HTTP Traffic Detected"; flow:to_server,established; content:"GET"; http_method; sid:1000001;)

Place your custom rules in a .rules file, such as custom.rules.

yaml
Copy code
rule-files:
  - /etc/suricata/rules/custom.rules

# Suricata Update Tool
Suricata also provides an update tool that can help keep your rules up-to-date. This tool automates the process of downloading and updating rules from Emerging Threats or Snort.

Install Suricata-Update:

	sudo pip install suricata-update

Run the Update:

	sudo suricata-update

This will download and update your rules as configured.

# Additional Tips:
Rule Management: If you are managing a large set of rules from different sources, consider using tools like PulledPork to automate rule management and avoid such issues.

Rule Organization: Keep your custom rules separate from the rules provided by external sources. This helps in avoiding conflicts when updating rule sets.

By resolving the duplicate rule, Suricata should start without any issues, and your rules will be correctly applied.
